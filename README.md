## How to Play

### PopulationGuessr

Pretty self explanatory, guess if the country on the right has higher or lower population than the country on the left.

### TimeLined

Drag historical events in the correct order on a timeline. Exact year doesn't matter at the moment, will fix a points system later maybe.

### WorldWits

Guess the famous location based on the given hints. Spelling doesn't need to be perfect.

### BehindYou

You are given an image that is facing away from a famous location, figure out which location is behind you.
